# About Me
* Graduate PhD in 12/2024!! I am now a postdoc at [UCLA Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/). My research focus lies in Autonomous Driving, Cooperative Driving Automation, and Intelligent Driving Algorithms.
* Before joining UCLA, I was a System Development Intern at [GE-Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.cn/). My internship projects are CT anatomy recommendation systems and CT image (skull) segmentation. 
* Before joining GE-China, I was a Deep Learning Intern at [SAIC General Motors Corporation](https://www.gmchina.com/company/cn/en/gm/home.html). I contributed to projects including parking space recognition, face recognition, and autonomous driving simulation.
* I received my master's degree from [WashU](https://wustl.edu/). 

# Highlights
* I have a comprehensive understanding of the whole pipeline of Autonomous Driving implementation.
* I have extensive experience in simulation, use case development, and performance testing for both single-vehicle automation and multi-vehicle cooperation.
* I have a profound understanding of HD-map, segmentation maps, and point cloud maps for modern autonomous driving algorithm stack. 
* I have rich experience in collecting and analyzing real-world data on Autonomous Vehicle platforms.
