# About Me
* I am a PhD candidate at [UCLA Mobility Lab](https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/). My research focus lies in Autonmous Driving, Cooperative Driving Automation, and Intelligent Driving Algorithms.
* Before joining UCLA, I was a System Development Intern at [GE-Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.cn/). My internship projects are CT anatomy recomendation system, and CT image (skull) segmentation. 
* Before joining GE-China, I was a Deep Learning Intern at [SAIC General Motors Corporation](https://www.gmchina.com/company/cn/en/gm/home.html). I contributed on projects including parking space recognition, face recognition, and autonomous driving simulation.
* I received my master degree from [WashU](https://wustl.edu/). 

# Highlights
* I have a comrehensive understanding of the whole pipeline of Autonomous Driving implementation.
* I have extensive experience in simulation, use case development, and performance testing for both single vehicle automation and multi-vehcile cooperation.
* I have profound understanding in HD-map, segmentation map, and point cloud map for modern Autonmous driving algorithm stack. 
* I have rich experience in collecting and analyzing real-world data on Autonomous Vehicle platforms.
